Codes of Death

Have you ever been in a situation when youâ€™re out and about and you see someone across the room that just 
takes your breath away? but then you're just too nervous and too afraid to approach the person! 
Well fear no more because IceBreaker is here to save the day. IceBreaker is an exclusive app designed to meet new 
people and perhaps your future significant other. IceBreaker will primarily target events, restaurants, clubs and pubs. 
It will be local in the sense that it can only be used at certain locations. Our app will allow you to strike up a 
conversation with anyone you fancy (who is at the same event as you), whether the other person chooses to reciprocate 
will be entirely their decision - no more fears of being rejected face-to-face with IceBreaker being around! 

P.S one of the features might even allow you to get a free drink/shot/prize after a certain number of rejections ;)
